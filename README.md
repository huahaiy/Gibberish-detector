# gibberish-detector

Gibberish-detector is a Clojure port of @rrenaud's python [gibberish detector](https://github.com/rrenaud/Gibberish-Detector).
For a full description of how it works, please refer to his README.

A key difference between this implementation and @rrenaud's is that in this implementation, false will be printed if a sentence is not gibberish and true will be printed if it is.

## Installation

```[juji/gibberish-detector "0.1.2-SNAPSHOT"]```

OR

```git clone https://github.com/slandau4/Gibberish-detector```
Note: You will have to do ```lein run``` in order for the program to generate the data file it needs to determine if input is gibberish. After that simply call is the ```is-gibberish?``` function in ```detect.clj```.

## Usage

Require ```[gibberish-detector.detect]```


## Examples

```(is-gibberish? "dafsfaenadf")``` => true

```(is-gibberish? "hello")``` => false

```(is-gibberish? "dafdsfa hello")``` => true

```(is-gibberish? "Hey what's up")``` => false

```(is-gibberish? "i adfsaf afeia dasf safsa nnn12")``` => true


### Might be Useful
#### Adding more data
##### big.txt
The ```big.txt``` file is used in ```trainer.clj``` to initialize the markov chain. 
```clojure
(with-open [rdr (clojure.java.io/reader "big.txt")]
  (doseq [line (line-seq rdr)]
    (doseq [[a b] (ngram 2 line)]
      (swap! counts #(update-in % [(pos a) (pos b)] inc)))))
```
If you wish to replace big.txt with another large text file, replace ```"big.txt"``` with the name of the new file. 
The new file should be located in the root project directory.

##### good.txt
The ```good.txt``` file is used in ```trainer.clj``` to obtain a vector of average-transition-probabilities of words we know to be not gibberish.
```clojure
(with-open [rdr (clojure.java.io/reader "good.txt")]
        (doseq [line (line-seq rdr)]
          (swap! good-probs #(conj % (avg-transition-prob line @counts)))))
```
If you wish to replace ```goood.txt``` with another file whose lines are NOT gibberish then simply change ```"good.txt"``` to the name of a new file located in the root project directory.

##### bad.txt
The ```bad.txt``` file is used in ```trainer.clj``` to obtain a vector of average-transition-probabilities of words we know to be gibberish.
Every line in ```bad.txt``` consists of random characters (aka gibberish).
```clojure
(with-open [rdr (clojure.java.io/reader "bad.txt")]
        (doseq [line (line-seq rdr)]
          (swap! bad-probs #(conj % (avg-transition-prob line @counts)))))
```
If you wish to replace ```bad.txt``` with another file whose lines are NOT gibberish then simply change ```"bad.txt"``` to the name of the new file located in the root project directory.
