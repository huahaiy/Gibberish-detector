# gibberish-detector

Gibberish-detector is a Clojure port of @rrenaud's python [gibberish detector](https://github.com/rrenaud/Gibberish-Detector).
For a full description of how it works, please refer to his README.

A key difference between this implementation and @rrenaud's is that in this implementation, false will be printed if a sentence is not gibberish and true will be printed if it is.
